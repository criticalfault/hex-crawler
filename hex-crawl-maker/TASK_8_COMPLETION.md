# Task 8 Completion: Build Property Dialog for Hex Content Editing

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive PropertyDialog component that allows GMs to edit hex properties including name, description, GM notes, and icon types. The dialog integrates seamlessly with the existing Redux state management and opens automatically when icons are placed or existing hexes are clicked.

## Implementation Details

### Core Component: PropertyDialog.tsx
- **Modal Dialog**: Full-screen backdrop with centered dialog box
- **Form Fields**: 
  - Name input (50 character limit)
  - Description textarea (500 character limit) 
  - GM Notes textarea (1000 character limit)
  - Icon type selector (Terrain/Landmark toggle buttons)
  - Icon dropdown (dynamically populated based on type)
- **Validation**: Real-time character counting and error messages
- **Redux Integration**: Connected to UI and Map slices for state management

### Styling: PropertyDialog.css
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and ARIA labels
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states, error styling, smooth animations
- **Professional UI**: Clean, modern design with proper spacing and typography

### Integration Points

#### HexGrid Component
- Modified drop handler to automatically open PropertyDialog when icons are placed
- Satisfies requirement 1.4: "dialog opens when icons are placed"

#### HexCell Component  
- Existing click handler already opens PropertyDialog for hexes with content
- Satisfies requirement 1.7: "allows editing existing hex properties"

#### App Component
- PropertyDialog added to main app structure
- Renders conditionally based on Redux state

### Redux State Management
- **UI Slice**: Manages dialog open/close state and selected hex
- **Map Slice**: Handles icon placement and property updates
- **Selectors**: Efficient data access for current hex properties

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.4**: Dialog opens when icons are placed  
✅ **Requirement 1.5**: Stores name, description, and GM notes with icon data  
✅ **Requirement 1.7**: Allows modification of icon type, description, and notes by clicking
