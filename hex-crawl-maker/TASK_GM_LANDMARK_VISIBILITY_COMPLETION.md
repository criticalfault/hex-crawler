# Task Completion: GM Mode Landmark Visibility

## Problem Solved
Game Masters could not easily identify landmark locations in GM Mode, as landmarks appeared as regular icons without any special visual treatment. This made it difficult to quickly spot points of interest during session preparation and gameplay.

## Solution Implemented
Added visual indicators for landmarks in GM Mode that complement the existing Player Mode indicators, making landmarks immediately obvious to GMs while maintaining the existing player experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced HexGrid Component (`src/components/HexGrid.tsx`)

#### Added GM Landmark Indicator Function
```typescript
const drawGMLandmarkIndicator = useCallback(
  (ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, center: PixelCoordinate, hexSize: number) => {
    // Draws a steel blue circle with white star (★) symbol
    // Size: 25% of hex size
    // Position: Top-right area of hex
  }, []
);
```

#### Added GM Mode Rendering Logic
```typescript
// Draw landmark indicator in GM mode if hex has a landmark
if (isGMMode && hexCell?.landmark) {
  drawGMLandmarkIndicator(ctx, pixelPos, appearance.hexSize);
}
```

#### Updated Dependencies
Added `drawGMLandmarkIndicator` to the render function's dependency array for proper React optimization.

### 2. Created Documentation (`GM_LANDMARK_INDICATORS.md`)
- Comprehensive guide explaining the new feature
- Visual design specifications
- Testing instructions
- Use cases for GMs and players
- Technical implementation details

### 3. Added Tests (`src/components/GMLandmarkIndicator.test.tsx`)
- Unit tests verifying component renders without errors
- Tests for both GM and Player modes
- Tests for landmark handling in both modes
- All tests passing ✅

## Visual Design

### GM Mode Indicators (NEW)
- **Shape**: Circular with white star (★)
- **Size**: 25% of hex size  
- **Colors**: Steel blue background (`rgba(70, 130, 180, 0.9)`), white star
- **Visibility**: Always visible for ALL landmarks in GM Mode

### Player Mode Indicators (EXISTING)
- **Shape**: Circular with question mark (?)
- **Size**: 30% of hex size
- **Colors**: Gold background (`rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.95)`), brown question mark
- **Visibility**: Only for landmarks with names/descriptions, respects exploration state

## Key Features

### For Game Masters
✅ **Instant Identification**: Blue star indicators make all landmarks immediately visible  
✅ **Universal Coverage**: Shows for ALL landmarks, not just those with content  
✅ **Always Visible**: No exploration state restrictions  
✅ **Distinct Design**: Different from player indicators to avoid confusion  

### For Players (Unchanged)
✅ **Discovery Hints**: Golden question marks indicate explorable content  
✅ **Selective Display**: Only shows for landmarks with names/descriptions  
✅ **Exploration Aware**: Respects visibility and exploration states  
✅ **Tooltip Integration**: Works seamlessly with hover tooltips  

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
1. Open browser console and run: `addTestLandmarks()`
2. Ensure you're in GM Mode - observe blue star indicators on landmarks
3. Switch to Player Mode - observe golden question mark indicators (selective)
4. Switch back to GM Mode - notice more indicators are visible
5. Clean up: `removeTestLandmarks()`

### Automated Tests
```bash
npx vitest run src/components/GMLandmarkIndicator.test.tsx
```
All tests passing ✅

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: Only draws when conditions are met
- **Scalable**: Indicators scale with hex size and zoom
- **Optimized**: Uses React useCallback for performance
- **Non-breaking**: No impact on existing functionality

## Future Enhancements
- Different indicator colors for different landmark types
- Customizable indicator styles in settings  
- Toggle option to hide/show GM indicators
- Keyboard shortcut to temporarily hide indicators

## Conclusion
The GM Mode landmark indicators successfully solve the visibility problem while maintaining the existing user experience. Game Masters can now easily identify all landmark locations at a glance, improving session preparation and gameplay flow. The feature integrates seamlessly with existing systems and provides a clear visual distinction between GM and Player modes.
