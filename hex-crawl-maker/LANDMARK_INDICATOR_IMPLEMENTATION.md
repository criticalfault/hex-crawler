# Landmark Visual Indicator - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Players could not easily identify hexes with landmarks when terrain was present, as landmarks were only visible through hover tooltips.

## Solution Implemented
Added a visual indicator (golden question mark circle) that appears on hexes with landmarks in Player Mode.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/HexGrid.tsx`
- **Added `drawLandmarkIndicator()` function**: Creates a golden question mark circle with shadow effect
- **Modified render loop**: Added landmark indicator drawing after player tokens
- **Added to dependencies**: Included `drawLandmarkIndicator` in the render function dependencies

### 2. New Files Created
- **`LANDMARK_INDICATOR_FEATURE.md`**: User documentation and testing instructions
- **`src/components/LandmarkIndicator.test.tsx`**: Unit tests for the feature
- **`LANDMARK_INDICATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**: This implementation summary

## Technical Details

### Visual Design
- **Shape**: Circular indicator with question mark
- **Size**: 30% of hex size (increased from initial 25% for better visibility)
- **Position**: Top-right area of hex (80% offset from center)
- **Colors**:
  - Background: Semi-transparent gold (`rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.95)`)
  - Border: Darker gold (`#b8860b`, 1.5px width)
  - Text: Dark brown (`#654321`)
  - Shadow: Subtle black shadow for depth

### Display Logic
The indicator appears when ALL conditions are met:
1. **Player Mode**: Only visible in Player Mode (not GM Mode)
2. **Has Landmark**: Hex contains a landmark property
3. **Is Visible**: Hex is visible to players (explored/in sight)
4. **Has Content**: Landmark has either a name OR description (prevents empty tooltips)

### Visibility States
- **Fully Visible**: Normal opacity when hex is currently visible
- **Previously Explored**: 60% opacity when hex was explored but not currently visible (line-of-sight mode)

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console and run: `addTestLandmarks()`
3. Switch to Player Mode
4. Observe golden question mark indicators on landmarks
5. Test hover tooltips still work
6. Move player tokens to test visibility states
7. Clean up: `removeTestLandmarks()`

### Automated Testing
- Run tests: `npm test -- LandmarkIndicator.test.tsx`
- Tests verify component renders without errors in different modes
- Tests check that indicators don't appear for landmarks without content

## Integration
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing tooltip system
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - only draws when conditions are met
- **Accessibility**: Provides visual cue without breaking existing hover interactions
- **Responsive**: Scales with hex size and zoom levels

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements could include:
- Different indicator styles for different landmark types
- Customizable indicator colors in settings
- Animation effects (subtle pulse or glow)
- Alternative indicator shapes (star, diamond, etc.)

## Conclusion
The landmark visual indicator successfully solves the visibility problem while maintaining the existing user experience. Players can now easily identify landmark locations at a glance, with detailed information still available through hover tooltips.
